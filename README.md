# reversePolishNotationCalculator
RPN calculator with inputs given on the command line

Reverse polish notation puts the operands before the operator. Several pre-microcomputer calculators used this format due to its structural simplicity. 

Examples:

run 1 1 +  
2.0000

run 1 2 3 * +  
7.0000

run 1 2 3 4 - \* 3 + /  
1.0000

run 1 2 3 4 *  
Insufficient input
